<h2 style="font-family:verdana; color:#333">Tens and Ones Column</h2>

<div style="line-height:2">
<p style="font-family:verdana; color:#333">The Tens and Ones Column Chart is used to demonstrate addition and subtraction in vertical format. It is design following the traffic light rules (green light means go, red light means stop). This is to remind the children to solve the ones column before moving to the tens column. Drag the numbers and symbol in the chart to form the vertical equation. Drag the equal sign to draw lines for the answer.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana; color:#333">If the addition involves carry forward, drag the digit on top of the first number in the tens column to mark the carried forward number.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana; color:#333">If the subtraction involves borrowing, drag the slash (/) on the first number in tens. The tool will automatically minus 1 from the given number and brings the 10 to the ones place.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana; color:#333">Double-click on the number to remove it from the chart. Drag another symbol to remove the used symbol in the chart.</p>
