When the shape is selected, use the up and down arrow sign to bring the shape to the front or back of other shapes. Use the plus (+) and minus (-) sign to scale the size of the shapes. When the shapes are overlapping, the scale will apply to the overlapped shapes. To discard, double-click on the shape.</p>
